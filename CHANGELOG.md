## 1.5

**IMPORTANT**: Distillery now requires that Bash be installed on the target system.
It turns out that this had been an implied dependency due to some of the features used
in the old script, but since it used `/bin/sh` in it's shebang, most platforms used Bash
automatically anyway. Those platforms which alias `/bin/sh` to something not Bash, such as
Ubuntu, were broken in some ways. This dependency on a specific shell's behaviour is now
explicit rather than implicit.

### Added

- Introduced new configuration option `included_configs`, which is a list of paths pointing to additional config files to be merged into `sys.config` at runtime.
- Support for Elixir 1.5
- Added `elixir` and `iex` helper functions for custom commands and hooks

### Changed

- The boot script architecture has been completely re-written
  - Support for OTP 20's new signal handler
  - Boot script is now broken up into smaller components for easier maintenance
  - Each command lives in it's own script now, using the same basic infra as custom commands
  - Improved documentation
- `pre_configure` is now run prior to any config initialization to provide an opportunity to set up the environment.

### Fixed

- Various documentation improvements
- Fix handling of dumb terminals (#298)
- Fix handling of consolidation path (#307)


## 1.4

### Changed

- `command` now automatically stops after command finishes executing
- `pre_configure` hook now runs prior to `command`
- Improved signal handling to return correct exit status codes


### Fixed

- Handling of `run_erl_env` is fixed
- Various potential bugs reported by shellcheck in boot scripts
- Compilation was broken on 1.3, it is now fixed

## 1.3

### Added

- Preliminary Windows support, feedback is welcome!

### Changed

- Only write `start_erl.data` when detecting ERTS

### Fixed

- #212 - missing profile option for release task
- #214 - run post_stop hooks after foreground exit

## 1.2.2

### Fixed

- Handling of configs during upgrades (#139)

## 1.2.1

### Fixed

- Handling of ERTS detection in boot script

## 1.2.0

### Added

- Add the ability to generate "executables (self-extracting archives),
  which can be used to build releases which can be used as command-line utilities.
  See `mix help release` for more info.
- Implement `reload_config` command for runtime reconfiguration
- Implement `pre_configure` hook which is now used prior to any time the configuration
 will be evaluated to ensure tools like conform are able to do their work first. This
 is being used in order to facilitate `reload_config`, and potentially other commands like
 it in the future.
- Implement simple API for the Release object for use by other libraries.

### Changed

- All errors are now handled via a single Errors module to unify error handling throughout
  the project. This should result in better errors everywhere
- Print more readabile usage information from boot script
- Parse options strictly to prevent unintended mistakes from going unnoticed

### Fixed

- Do a better job of detecting valid release versions
- Certain environment config options are ignored (#204)
- Fix win32 executable exit conditions (#202) - Matt Enlow
- Ensure code_change/4 is detected for special processes

### Added

- 565bea5 - Erlang distribution cookie made configurable - Thomas Stratmann

### Changed

- You can now override the start type of applications by using
  `set applications: [app: start_type]` in `rel/config.exs`. Previously,
  this would only work if the application was not present in the applications
  list of `mix.exs`
- If you provide a custom `sys.config` with `set sys_config: path`, it will now
  be merged over the top of the one that would be generated from `config.exs`, so
  that you can override settings per-environment.
