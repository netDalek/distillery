# Using Distillery with systemd

Here are three general approaches to running a Distillery release with Systemd:
#### 1. Run app as daemon using `start` and a `forking` Systemd service *with* pidfile
* Systemd can automatically restart your app if it crashes
* You'll need to generate a pidfile for your app. The [pid_file](https://github.com/OvermindDL1/pid_file) package makes this quite simple.
* Logs will be written to the `/logs` directory in your release


		[Unit]
		Description=My App
		After=network.target

		[Service]
		Type=forking
		User=appuser
		Group=appuser
		WorkingDirectory=/home/appuser/myapp
		ExecStart=/home/appuser/myapp/bin/myapp start
		ExecStop=/home/appuser/myapp/bin/myapp stop
		PIDFile=/home/appuser/myapp/myapp.pid
		Restart=on-failure
		RestartSec=5
		Environment=PORT=8080
		Environment=LANG=en_US.UTF-8
		SyslogIdentifier=myapp
		RemainAfterExit=no

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target
		

#### 2. Run app as daemon using `start` and a `forking` Systemd service *without* pidfile
* Systemd will attempt (and probably fail) to guess your apps pid. Without the correct pid it will be unable to automatically restart your app if it crashes
* No need for pidfiles
* Logs will be written to the `/logs` directory in your release

		[Unit]
		Description=My App
		After=network.target

		[Service]
		Type=forking
		User=appuser
		Group=appuser
		WorkingDirectory=/home/appuser/myapp
		ExecStart=/home/appuser/myapp/bin/myapp start
		ExecStop=/home/appuser/myapp/bin/myapp stop
		Restart=on-failure
		RestartSec=5
		Environment=PORT=8080
		Environment=LANG=en_US.UTF-8
		SyslogIdentifier=myapp
		RemainAfterExit=no

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target


#### 3. Run app in `foreground` using a `simple` Systemd configuration
* Systemd can automatically restart your app if it crashes
* No need for pidfiles or pid-detection
* Logging is handled by systemd

		[Unit]
		Description=My App
		After=network.target

		[Service]
		Type=simple
		User=appuser
		Group=appuser
		WorkingDirectory=/home/appuser/myapp
		ExecStart=/home/appuser/myapp/bin/myapp foreground
		ExecStop=/home/appuser/myapp/bin/myapp stop
		Restart=on-failure
		RestartSec=5
		Environment=PORT=8080
		Environment=LANG=en_US.UTF-8
		SyslogIdentifier=myapp
		RemainAfterExit=no

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target

		
Reportedly, if you get an error starting the service you may need to set `RemainAfterExit=yes`. While this may resove the issue it will prevent Systemd from restarting your app if it crashes.
